NAME
    Plack::Session::Store::MongoDB - MongoDB based session store for Plack
    apps.

SYNOPSIS
            use Plack::Builder;
            use Plack::Middleware::Session;
            use Plack::Session::Store::MongoDB;

            my $app = sub {
                    return [ 200, [ 'Content-Type' => 'text/plain' ], [ 'Hello Foo' ] ];
            };

            builder {
                    enable 'Session',
                            store => Plack::Session::Store::MongoDB->new(
                                    session_db_name => 'myapp',
                                    coll_name => 'myapp_sessions',  # defaults to 'session'
                                    host => 'mongodb.myhost.com',   # defaults to 'localhost'
                                    port => 27017                   # this is the default
                            );
                    $app;
            };

            # alternatively, you can just pass a MongoDB::Connection object:
            builder {
                    enable 'Session',
                            store => Plack::Session::Store::MongoDB->new(
                                    session_db_name => 'myapp',
                                    conn => MongoDB::Connection->new
                            );
                    $app;
            };

DESCRIPTION
    This module implements a MongoDB storage for session data. This has the
    advantage of being a simple (no need to generate a database scheme or
    even create the necessary database/collections), yet powerful backend.

    It requires, of course, a running MongoDB daemon to work with.

METHODS
  new( %params )
    Creates a new instance of this module. Requires a hash of parameters
    containing 'session_db_name' with the name of the MongoDB database to
    use and any options available by MongoDB::Connection, most probably
    'host' (the hostname of the server where the MongoDB daemon is running,
    defaults to 'localhost') and 'port' (the port where the MongoDB daemon
    is listening, defaults to 27017, the default MongoDB port). You can also
    optionally pass the 'coll_name' parameter, denoting the name of the
    collection in which sessions will be stored (will default to
    'sessions').

    Alternatively, you can pass a 'conn' parameter and give it an already
    created MongoDB::Connection object. You will still need to pass
    'session_db_name' when doing this.

    NOTE: in versions before 0.3, the 'session_db_name' option was called
    'db_name'. This has been changed since 'db_name' is a
    MongoDB::Connection option that might differ from you session database,
    and you should be able to pass both if you need to.

  fetch( $session_id )
    Fetches a session object from the database.

  store( $session_id, \%session_obj )
    Stores a session object in the database. If a database error occurs when
    attempting to store the session, this method will die.

  remove( $session_id )
    Removes the session object from the database. If a database error occurs
    when attempting to remove the session, this method will generate a
    warning.
